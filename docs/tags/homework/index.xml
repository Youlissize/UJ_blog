      <description>In such a world, where mixed reality has become the only reality for the majority of the population, we could expect a lot of terrifying scenarios.
The main issue I could see is the power that is given to people who are controlling what is displayed. With such a powerful tool, it is incredibly easy to manipulate all the population as you wish. You could for example create restricted area where the image will become fuzzy if you go in, and you could also remove all sign of propestation against the technology itself.</description>

      <description>This ultimate display which could be able to create anything hardly fits in any previous notions of virtual/reality distinctions.
It is not the real world as we know it, because it is created by a computer, so ther is something &amp;ldquo;virtual&amp;rdquo; inside. But is it virtual? No, it&amp;rsquo;s true matter, it exists, in front of our eyes, it&amp;rsquo;s not only a mental construction of our brain like with a screen. So it must be between virtual and real?</description>

      <description>Idea 1 : Gliding like an Eagle Why : Who never dream to fly like a bird? But flapping wings must be so tiring&amp;hellip; The solution? Gliding of course!
How : Each arm will of course represent a wing, so the controllers will give the etremity of each wings, and their orientation represent the wing orientation. So pointing the controller forward represent a &amp;ldquo;flat&amp;rdquo; wing, which is the most common position, and you can then decide to point up or down for rotate your wings.</description>

      <description>In Theory : The main goal was to feel like this :
Interactions These are the 4 main interaction you can have : - Going Up/Down : Point Up/Down controllers - Roll : Just move your arms - Dive : Fold your arms - Slown down when messing up : When your wings are not aligned with your velocity
In Practice : Controls First of all we need a way to control our bird.</description>
