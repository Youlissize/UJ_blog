      <description>In such a world, where mixed reality has become the only reality for the majority of the population, we could expect a lot of terrifying scenarios.
The main issue I could see is the power that is given to people who are controlling what is displayed. With such a powerful tool, it is incredibly easy to manipulate all the population as you wish. You could for example create restricted area where the image will become fuzzy if you go in, and you could also remove all sign of propestation against the technology itself.</description>

      <description>This ultimate display which could be able to create anything hardly fits in any previous notions of virtual/reality distinctions.
It is not the real world as we know it, because it is created by a computer, so ther is something &amp;ldquo;virtual&amp;rdquo; inside. But is it virtual? No, it&amp;rsquo;s true matter, it exists, in front of our eyes, it&amp;rsquo;s not only a mental construction of our brain like with a screen. So it must be between virtual and real?</description>
