      <description>As proposed, I used hugo for creating this site. I juste sad some small issues at the beginning because of a bad config file, but once this was right, it seems really straightforward and easy to use. Really easier to code all by yourself, fortunately!
But when I tried to upload my page on github, the Hugo theme has vanished, and my blog was looking really bad. It was really long to me to fix this little error.</description>

      <description>I actually didn&amp;rsquo;t have much trouble about this lab, everything was working pretty quickly when I was following the instructions. I found this introduction interessting, and the result is satisfying! There is really few lines of code, and the game is quite fun to play (at least for 30 seconds).
The only little customisation I made is probably the amazing color gradient I put on the winning message, as we can see below.</description>
