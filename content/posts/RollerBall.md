I actually didn't have much trouble about this lab, everything was working pretty quickly when I was following the instructions. 
I found this introduction interessting, and the result is satisfying! There is really few lines of code, and the game is quite fun to play (at least for 30 seconds).

The only little customisation I made is probably the amazing color gradient I put on the winning message, as we can see below.

That wasn't the first time I used unity, I already had a small introduction this year with Télécom. But I also have a lot of experience on Unreal Engine, so many notions were really familiar to me, the main difference is probably the use of scripts and prefabs, for the transforms, physics forces, files organisation, etc, it is in fact very similar. At last, all this hours using Unreal Engine are usefull in my studies!
