As proposed, I used hugo for creating this site. I juste sad some small issues at the beginning because of a bad config file,
but once this was right, it seems really straightforward and easy to use. Really easier to code all by yourself, fortunately!

But when I tried to upload my page on github, the Hugo theme has vanished, and my blog was looking really bad. It was really long to me to fix this little error. First I saw that was an issue about a css file not found, so I tried to change the publish directory, the directory that github is using for the website, change the base URL (by adding "/", or "/docs" or "/docs/"), but nothing was working at all.

In fact I saw that there wasn't always this issue of css file, the path to the css seems to be the right one. But sometimes there was a "page not found", or a strange error about content privacy policy, or the theme was here but links to articles were failing. But most of the time there wasn't any error, github was saying "you're site is published", but still no theme.

After hours of random tests, when I was reading the site inspector, I reloaded the page, and then , Alleluia, It was working perfectly! In fact I just didn't wait enough for github (or my veeeery slow computer) to "compile" or "apply" the css.
I felt a little dumb after all of this, but finally I'm done!
