This ultimate display which could be able to create anything hardly fits in any previous notions of virtual/reality distinctions.

It is not the real world as we know it, because it is created by a computer, so ther is something "virtual" inside. 
But is it virtual? No, it's true matter, it exists, in front of our eyes, it's not only a mental construction of our brain like with a screen. 
So it must be between virtual and real? Or outside this segment? 

Personnaly I don't think that it could be placed in the Reality-Virtuality continuum of Milgram, neither as a point, a segment or an infinite line. It seems that this display is a singular point which is both on the Reality and the Virtuality points. This kind of display would create a space where reality IS virtual, and virtuality IS real. 

Because you can't make any difference between the real world and a displayed world, this is real, there is matter. But this matter is controlled by a computer, so the matter was virtually arranged to match a certain organisation in space, to match a virtual world that was computed. So the difference with a "real" environment would only be the way it has been made, "naturally" or "by a computer". This is the same kind of fuzzy difference between what we call "natural things" and "artificial things", but here the human is replaced by a computer.
